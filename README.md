# StayHydrated | Client

This client contains the actual code, using Python 3.7.4 and PySimpleGUI.

What can you do with the StayHydrated client? Simple trolls such as shutting down you coworker's computer, shaming your older brother for not drinking the daily 8 gallons of water by mass texting all of his friends, adding punishments to your daughter for not completing her homework before dinner by redirecting YouTube to Wikipedia.

The main purpose of StayHydrated is to make sure you and your companions are staying hydrated; on the server, you can customize how hydrated someone needs to be or how "hydrated" someone needs to be in terms of number of pushups, eye strain, and completed tasks.

The client is designed to simply hack your computer and be monitored by your private network's admin, which by the way, your router likely has a web address of 192.168.0.1 with the username and password being admin and password.

What else can the clients do? Well, whenever someone does not meet the daily "hydration," a **default OR custom command can be executed on victim's computer, e.g. forcefully shutting down the computer, blue screen of death (Windows only), and free redirects from YouTube to your favorite website -- just in time for the boss to see.** That custom command can be written by the client or customized by you (Python and Java only).

To download this, press the green button that says Download ZIP. Using your python interpreter, execute main.py and answer the questionnaire.
