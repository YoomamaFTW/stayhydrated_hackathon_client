# StayHydrated | Client

This client contains the actual code, using Python 3.7.4 and PySimpleGUI.

For executables (i.e. an easier time), go [here for the download page](https://yoomamaftw.github.io/stayhydrated_hackathon_client/).

This is NOT for the server. Server setup can be found [here](https://github.com/Stoffel2107/stayhydrated_hackathon_backend).
